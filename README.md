# Restaurant

This app shows the menu of a restaurant, pulled from https://resto.mprog.nl/menu. You can choose a dish, view its details and add it to your order. In 'Your Order' you can submit the order. The delivery time, also pulled from resto.mprog.nl, will be showed as seen in the screenshots. The table view contains a standard cell, but the data in resto.mprog.nl isn't applicable to this. The simplest way to fix this would be to change the data, but I can't do that. I would suggest:
* short dish titles
* square images
